I'm a Technical Architect with the Salesforce Business Unit at Perficient, **but this blog, its content and opinions are my own**. I spend my days thinking big, solving in-depth problems, and designing enterprise-scale systems for our clients. I'm 5x Salesforce certfied working towards my Technical Architect certification and a 2x Dreamforce presenter.

## Background 

> TL;DR I consider myself a "full-stack" developer with enough breadth and depth to tackle just about anything. I have over 20 years experience devloping solutions for the web. Those solutions ranged from a classic ASP site written in VBScript to a custom CMS and back-office college curriculum review app written in PHP to Salesforce Communities and Sitecore websites written in Apex and C#. These days my particular brand of poison is JavaScript.

Before I was a Technical Architect, I was a Software Engineer and Team Lead of Web Engineering at Sundog Interactive (prior to being acquired by Perficient). 

As a software engineer, I developed solutions for both Salesforce and Sitecore. For Salesforce I developed VisualForce pages and Lightning Components with Apex, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For Sitecore I developed Renderings and Layouts with C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

As a Team Lead, I mentored and managed a small team of developers whose focus was developing components with Salesforce Lightning, emails and landing pages in Marketing Cloud, and renderings and layouts in Sitecore.

Prior to Sundog Interactive, I was a Web Developer at Minnesota State Community and Technical College where I helped write a custom CMS for the college's public facing website and an app to facilitate curriculum approval and review.

I currently live with my wife, three sons, and a Great Pyreneese in Moorhead, MN where I work from home.

When I'm not working or spending time with my family, I enjoy painting tabletop miniatures and cutting timbers for timber framing projects.
